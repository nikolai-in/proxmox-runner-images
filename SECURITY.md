# 🛡️ Security

If you discover a security issue in the [upstream repo](https://github.com/actions/runner-images), please submit it through the [GitHub Security Bug Bounty](https://hackerone.com/github), but if the issue is only in changes made only in this repo it is best to open an issue without disclosing too much information first.

Thanks ^. .^ !
